# FreeForm exporting

FreeForm exporting allows selecting the area of interest within the render to
export. Guide lines can be enabled by holding the `Shift` key and they are
drawn with respect to the last point added. If the `Shift+Alt` keys are
held the guide lines are drawn from the first point added:

<video controls class="video-js" data-setup='{fill: true}'>
 <source src="assets/freeform.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>
